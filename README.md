# Clue
Clue is a C# project that reimagines the classic board game Clue as an interactive minigame adventure. Players solve puzzles to collect clue cards and deduce the identity of the mysterious murderer, as well as the location and weapon of the crime.

## Gameplay
Players navigate an interactive world map, traveling to different countries where they are faced with ocean-themed mini games. Winning a mini game rewards the player with two clue cards, each representing a suspect, weapon, or location that cannot be part of the correct solution. These cards help the player eliminate possibilities and narrow down the mystery. If a player loses a mini game, they are sent back to the world map, where they can choose another location and attempt a different challenge. Once the player has collected enough clue cards to make an informed deduction, they can guess the murderer, the weapon, and the location of the crime. A correct guess results in victory, while an incorrect guess requires the player to restart and try again
